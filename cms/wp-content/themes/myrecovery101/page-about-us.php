With a diverse background in psychology, life coaching, and holistic wellness, I am deeply passionate about guiding individuals along their paths to recovery and empowering them to unlock their unique potential. 
Prior to establishing My Recovery 101, I spent several years in the sector in both support coordination and management roles within a larger mental health organisation. During this time, I witnessed the importance of personalised care and the profound impact it has on individuals. Motivated by a growing desire to offer tailored support that truly addresses people's needs, I founded My Recovery 101. At the core of our approach is the belief that every individual deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, not merely as a number in the system—an unfortunate reality all too common in this industry.
At My Recovery 101, we love to get to know you as a person and strive to foster genuine connections and provide holistic support that honours the uniqueness of each person's journey. We are committed to walking alongside our clients, offering compassionate guidance, and creating a safe space for growth and healing to occur.

With a background in Project Management, I thrive on organisation and efficiency, always striving to get things done promptly. My dedication to mental health support stems from my upbringing; my mother led a charity focused on Schizophrenia, fostering a nurturing and inclusive environment where I learned the importance of supporting individuals and families.

Over time, I've immersed myself in training related to various mental health disorders and proudly served as a Mental Health First Aider at my previous workplace. I’m originally from  Sweden and then I made my way to the UK in my youth before embarking on my latest adventure in Australia. Balancing the joyful chaos of motherhood with two lively children (three if you count my husband!) I love creative pursuits like crafts and baking during my downtime. 

In my role as a Support Coordinator and Recovery Coach at My Recovery 101, I'm excited about the opportunity to work with you on your journey to living your best life! I pride myself on thinking outside the box, tailoring personalised solutions to suit the unique needs of each participant. I’m approachable and warm-hearted and I'm always here to listen and chat, so feel free to reach out if there's anything you'd like to know!

Supporting participants with open and clear communication in a
safe, comfortable setting helps me to get to the nitty-gritty of what
you want your life to look like and how I can best help you actualise
that. I am particularly passionate in supporting participants who have
been experiencing challenges with their mental health. Having seen
first-hand how mental illness can be received by the public, I am on
a personal mission to make sure participants feel seen, heard and 
respected in their community and in wider society.">

I am a highly skilled Credentialed Mental Health Nurse with a wealth of experience spanning 25 years of dedicated practice in both the United Kingdom and Australia. My training in the UK laid a robust foundation for a diverse and rewarding career that has traversed a multitude of environments.

With a passion for providing holistic care, I have navigated a variety of  settings, including in-patient units, community mental health teams, high secure forensic and non-government organisations. This breadth of experience has honed my ability to adapt nursing practices to meet the unique needs of individuals across different environments.
 
Throughout my career, I have been a proponent of evidence-based practices, continually integrating the latest research and methodologies into my nursing approach. This dedication has not only enhanced my clinical skills but also positioned myself as a mentor and educator across the diverse landscapes of my employment.
I always strive to demonstrate a compassionate and empathetic approach to individual care delivery whilst highly valuing the importance of building rapport and a trusting therapeutic relationship. I also recognise the profound impact these relationships have on the person’s recovery journey, their family and communities.

Currently, I continue to actively contribute to the field of mental health nursing, engaging across various settings, including in-patient units and within the NDIS space. My focus remains on advocating for and championing recovery-focused mental health services.

            <div class="team-member" data-name="Dominic" data-position="Support Coordinator" data-description="Hi I'm Dom, 
A little bit about me and how I ended up here in Sydney... Having got a one way flight to New Delhi in 2010 I travelled far and wide for 2.5 years before realising Sydney is where I can see myself creating a life in. 
So, along with my degree in criminology, A levels in Sociology and Psychology, I moved from the UK to Australia in 2017 to study a masters in social work. Since completing this, I have been working in mental health for approximately 5 years.
Having previously worked in finance I realised my real passion was outside of an office, working with people and supporting those to improve their lives and realise their potential regardless of any difficulties they may live with.
I believe everybody has a purpose and potential to contribute so much in society and eradicate the previous stigma that was associated with mental health.

Having been a Support coordinator for over 3 years, I have created a wide network of services and supports which can help those NDIS participants reach for the stars. 

I would say I'm pretty calm, laid back, positive and fun loving which I bring both into work and outside of work. 

In my spare time I like to play football, scuba dive and snowboard when I can, as well as go on adventures, socialise with friends and drink far too much coffee than recommended!
